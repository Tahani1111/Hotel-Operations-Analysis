# Hotel-Operations-Analysis

## Introduction 
The hospitality industry is highly competitive and data-driven. With increasing online bookings, changing customer behaviors, and the impact of cancellations on revenue, hotels need smart insights to optimize their operations, pricing, and marketing strategies. This project analyzes hotel booking data to uncover trends in customer behavior, booking patterns, and revenue generation.

Using tools like Excel, SQL Server, and Power BI, the dataset is cleaned, explored, and visualized to help stakeholders make informed decisions. Key areas of focus include booking trends, cancellation patterns, seasonal performance, customer segmentation, and revenue insights.

## Problem Statement
Hotel businesses often face challenges such as high cancellation rates, inconsistent revenue flow across seasons, and limited visibility into customer booking behaviors. Without proper analysis, it's difficult to:

- Identify which segments contribute most to revenue.

- Optimize room pricing and marketing strategies.

- Anticipate customer demand across different times of the year.
  
The goal of this analysis is to explore hotel booking data and uncover actionable insights that can help:

## Data Cleaning 
The dataset was cleaned by standardizing column names, fixing inconsistencies in text and dates, and handling missing values such as replacing blanks in the children column with 0 and undefined meal entries with the mode. Additional improvements included correcting week numbers, adding a Booking ID, converting country codes to full names, and replacing zero adr values with the average. Finally, the file was converted to a UTF-8 CSV for SQL compatibility, ensuring a structured and analysis-ready dataset.

## Modeling 
The model is a star schema.
There are 9-dimension tables and 1 fact table. The dimension tables are all joined to the fact table one 
to-many relationship.
